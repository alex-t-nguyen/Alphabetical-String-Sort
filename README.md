# Alphabetical-String-Sort
Compose a program to
arrange the characters in
“Hello, world!\n” in numerical
order, smallest value to
largest, and print out the
result. That will of course
mean that the string of
characters looks more or less
like gibberish, but the
characters will be in proper
numerical order, smallest to
largest.

- Note that this requires a
recursive program to be done
properly. As for the other two
problems in this set, you can
paste a copy of the program to
the right for your records, if
you wish.
